### Binary2Decimal Converter Script Using Java
##### Notes/Preamble
- This project script builds from "app ideas" by Florin Pop https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas
- This Binary2Decimal conversion script is based on the first exercise [https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Bin2Dec-App.md] , only that the focus is on Java.

#### Script Exaplaination
- The Java Script illustrates Binary to Decimal Conversion
- To complete this, we rely on parseInt() method
- Also, there is reliance on Scanner class for gettin user input
- This script ensures that there is input Validation using Scanner class
- To complete the validation, Scanner's hasNext() method is used
- It is only after the successful validation, that there is subsequent conversion of Binary to Decimal
- If the validation fails, i.e., entry elements are neither 0's or 1's, the "else" statement executes
